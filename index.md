Dependency-Track is an intelligent [Component Analysis](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Component_Analysis) platform that allows organizations to
identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Dependency-Track takes a unique
and highly beneficial approach by leveraging the capabilities of [Software Bill of Materials](https://owasp.org/www-community/Component_Analysis#software-bill-of-materials-sbom) (SBOM). This approach
provides capabilities that traditional Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solutions cannot achieve.

Dependency-Track monitors component usage across all versions of every application in its portfolio in order to
proactively identify risk across an organization. The platform has an API-first design and is ideal for use in
CI/CD environments.
